# DRUMMER
Detection of RNA modifications mediated by error rates (DRUMMER) is a software packaged designed to identify RNA modifications at both transcript and nucleotide-level resolution through the comparative analysis of Nanopore direct RNA sequencing (DRS) datasets. 

DRUMMER was designed and implemented by Jonathan Abebe and Daniel Depledge


## Introduction
Experimental design defines the context of analysis and the modifications likely to be identified. For instance, comparison of DRS datasets from a parental cell line and METTL3-knockout cell line allows for the detection of m6A.




## Data preparation

DRUMMER requires sorted.bam files containing transcriptome- or genome-level read alignments for each of the two experimental conditions being compared. Note that this is **_the_** most critical consideration when running DRUMMER (or comparable tools). Working to the adage that what you give is what you get, it is vital that **_you_** are confident that the following conditions are satisified.

- each read has a single (primary) alignment. All secondary/supplemental alignments have been filtered out
- each read is aligned against the correct transcript sequence (transcriptome analysis only)

The choice of alignment & filtering parameters for generated the input sorted.bam files will always be context dependent. For instance, our work on [mapping the locations of m6A modifications on the adenovirus Ad5 transcriptome](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/865485v1) required careful filtering of sequence alignments due to the preence of numerous overlapping transcripts that shared the same 5' and/or 3' ends. Following a detailed [characterization of the Adenovirus AD5 transcriptome](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.876037v1), we subequently aligned our nanopore DRS datasets against the transcriptome as follows

```
minimap2 -t 8 -ax map-ont -p 0.99 Ad5.transcriptome.fasta dataset1.reads.fq > dataset1.aligned.sam

samtools view -h dataset1.aligned.sam | awk ' ( $5 > 0 || $1 ~ /SQ/ ) ' | awk ' ( $2 == 0 || $1 ~ /SQ/ ) ' | awk ' ( $6 !~ /H/ || $1 ~ /SQ/ ) ' | samtools view -b - > dataset1.aligned.bam

samtools sort -o dataset1.aligned.sorted.bam dataset1.aligned.bam

samtools index dataset1.aligned.sorted.bam
```
