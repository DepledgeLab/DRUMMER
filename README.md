Detection of RNA modifications mediated by error rates (DRUMMER) is a software packaged designed to identify RNA modifications at both transcript and nucleotide-level resolution through the comparative analysis of Nanopore direct RNA sequencing (DRS) datasets. 

Experimental design defines the context of analysis and the modifications likely to be identified. For instance, comparison of DRS datasets from a parental cell line and METTL3-knockout cell line allows for the detection of m6A.
